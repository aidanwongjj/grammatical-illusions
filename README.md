### Grammatical illusions
Certain ungrammatical sentences are very often accepted and produced by native speakers. An example is in (1):
> (1) The key to the cabinets are on the table.

In (1), the verb are expresses the wrong “agreement”: because the subject is singular (key), the verb should have been is, but the sentence is still judged as natural by many speakers. Why and when does this happen? Do speakers sometimes simply fail to pay attention to verbal agreement? Read Wagers, Lau, and Phillips and introduce the phenomenon and their findings.
